# Neovim Config!

Hello!
This is my personal Neovim configuration. You can probably tell that it is eerily similar to the kickstart.nvim project, that is because it is. 

I am pretty new to configuring Neovim as my IDE so I have chosen to use Kickstart.nvim as a template to start out with and will most probably commit a lot of changes to this directory over time as I make Neovim my own. :D
